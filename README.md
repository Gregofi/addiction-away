# Addiction away
## What it does
This extension helps to migitate addiction-inducing websites like youtube. It removes certain parts of the website to make it less likely to full rabbit-hole but still keeps them usable.
### Youtube
- Hides all recommended videos on the main page
### Facebook
- Instantly redirects you to `facebook.com/messages`, so you see only chat
## Why I made it
Because i spent too much time watching youtube videos that I have no reason to watch. Or scrolling endlessly through facebook when I just wanted to reply to someone.

There are certainly better extensions that do the same. I created mine to have an excuse to learn firefox extensions at least a little bit.
